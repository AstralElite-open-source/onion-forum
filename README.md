# Onion Forum (lightweight Flask)

A tiny, fast forum designed to run well behind a Tor hidden service (.onion). No accounts, minimal JavaScript (none by default), CSRF-protected forms, and SQLite storage.

## Features

- Minimal dependencies (Flask + SQLite)
- Fast server-side rendering, compact CSS only
- CSRF token on forms
- Pagination for threads and posts
- Works well over Tor (.onion)
